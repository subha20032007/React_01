✨ Today I Learned: React Context API 🎉

As I continue my journey with React, I explored the Context API, and wow, it’s a game-changer for managing state across components without prop drilling! 🚀

Here’s a quick breakdown of what I learned:
1️⃣ What is it?

A powerful way to share state globally in a React app.
Great for scenarios like theme management, user authentication, or app-wide settings.
2️⃣ How it works?

Wrap a component tree in a Provider and consume data with a Consumer or useContext hook.
Cleaner, more scalable code, especially for deeply nested components.
3️⃣ What I love about it:

Simplifies state sharing.
Reduces the hassle of prop drilling.
Makes code more maintainable.
I’m excited to integrate it into my projects and improve the developer experience. Shoutout to the React team for this awesome feature! 💡
